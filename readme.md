*With this repo you can update game files and keep the configuration, from the V1 framework. Is used to update the swedish version for example.*

You have to add a `config.py` in order for this to run as expected.
```
github_token = "token_here"
framework_path = "path_to_update"
framework_folder_name = "framework_folder_name"
```
